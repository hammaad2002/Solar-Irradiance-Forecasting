# Solar Irradiance Forecasting Using Deep Learning Techniques

This repository contains a comparative analysis of deep learning techniques for solar irradiance forecasting using a dataset from Karachi, our local city. The goal of this research is to determine the most effective algorithm among four different models for predicting solar irradiance.

The dataset and code files are included in this repository. The code was originally executed on Kaggle but has been uploaded through Google Colab for easier access, viewing, and experimentation by others. To run the code in Google Colab, simply replace all instances of the path '/kaggle/working' with '/content/' in the code file. After making these changes, you can execute the entire code using the 'Run All' option.

The link to the research paper will be provided once it is published in the journal. Stay tuned for updates!
